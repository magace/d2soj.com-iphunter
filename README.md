**This will send your iphunter games to d2soj.com so you can hopefully manage your walk a little easier.**

**Install:  Replace your IPHunter.js with this one...**

Make sure to update logname to your d2soj.com account name.

**Note:**

The kill button just moves game to old game section.  When you have like 20 to kill it comes in handy to just click kill and get it out of your current game list.

The release button sends the game back to the unassigned game list. 

I still have some stuff to do but if anyone could test this and report how it does that would be great.

Export Button will export your current games to a special format to be used in my modified IPHolder.dbj that will rejoin the game if it drops. (Not yet posted)

**Once you start finding ips it should look something like this once you log into d2soj.com**

To DO on the website:
Create roles like "Walker", and "Follower" then allow "Followers" to subscribe to "Walkers"  Then when the "Walkers" hunt games only the "Followers" can request games from the appropriate "Walker".
The request game link needs to use the realm cookie to request to appropriate "Walkers" realm.
